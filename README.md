## Calendar
The Calendar page is the heart of this website - it's where all the magic happens! Since my main goal is collecting your trading data to create those AI reports, I made this page super important. I kept it simple and easy to use, but still packed it with cool features like month/year views and your complete trading history. Adding new trades is a breeze - just click on any day to pop up the entry dialog, or quickly jump between months in the year view. No complicated stuff, just a straightforward way to log your trades!

# üì± Landing Page & Mobile Version

I'm very happy with the landing page design and its mobile version. Every part of the landing page is interactive, providing a richer user experience. At the same time, I'm using **Next.js** SSG to make the page performant and keep load times short.
